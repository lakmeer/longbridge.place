# Content Preprocessing

- Collect all slugs
- Scrape markdown body for links
- Scrape markdown frontmatter for tags
- Collate all tags with slugs of tagged content, and save to a file or sqlite
- Examine slugs in body links and make sure they match an existing file
- Save relational graph of linked entries to sqlite so it can gather relevant pages for LLM edits
