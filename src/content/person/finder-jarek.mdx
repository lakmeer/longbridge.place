Jarek is a private detective and amateur attrapulser, currently working in
Leans. He is a textbook grizzled, hard-boiled loner, who downplays his
secretly-not-so-modest attrapulsive skills to gain a slim but important
advantage in the cases he is hired to solve.

As a drifter, Jarek does not take a residential auxiliary name.
