Trix is a 30 year old mix vendor with a [shophouse](lore:shophouses) near
[Mackintosh Square](location:mackintosh). She is a skilled mixer, is shrewd and
street-smart, and doesn't associate with many people. She is a habitual user of
the popular narcotic ‘[fancy](lore:fancy)’, and sells it to customers who know
how to ask for it, whereby she earned her day name.

Trix was born in the year 967 to unknown parents. She grew up an orphan at a
[commonhouse](lore:commonhouses) in Mackintosh, where she was [tended](lore:tending) 
by four adults, Soren, Terryn, Firth and Sym, who kept her warm and fed but
didn't have much time to spend with her. After showing interest in [mixing](lore:mixing)
at an early age, Tender Terryn tried to teach her basic skills, and she was
eventually sent to apprentice with a local mixer, Mixing Vendor Master Maelyn,
who taught her the trade from the age of 12.

As a young child, Trix did not have many friends, and has always [decorated her
own shoes](lore:shoe-decorating). She finished her [juntari](lore:juntari) at 
the age of 16, and moved out of the commonhouse to live with Master Maelyn in
dir shop near Mackintosh Square. She spent the next 7 years working as a mixer
under dem, until dir death in 990, whereupon she inherited the shop and began
operating it herself.

Master Maelyn was a skilled mixer but not a particularly good teacher. Trix
learned advanced techniques by carefully watching dem work, and by reading
books from [Eloryn](lore:eloryn). She owns a very ancient copy of "The Art of
Mixing" which she won in a game of cards at the [Travesty Inn](location:travesty-inn)
by betting Maelyn's unique mixing glassware. While experimenting, Trix
accidentally developed a novel mix which appears to induce lucid dreaming, but
did not think much of it.

Trix is a habitual user of [fancy](lore:fancy), and has been since she
discovered Maelyn had been secretly mixing fancy for customers. She used to
steal flasks of it to take to local taverns to trade with locals for valuable
items and favours. After she learned to mix it herself, she earned a reputation
for high quality product and her day name among locals. She makes a respectable
amount of money selling it, and has wears [nail polish](lore:aurum#aurum-poisoning).

She has lived and worked at the shophouse since Maelyn's death in 990, and has
a good reputation as a mixer. She doesn't have many friends and spends most of
her time working, reading, or mixing fancy. Her only close friend is
[Travesty Tym](person:travesty-tym), proprietor of the Travesty Inn, where she
spends many hours drinking, gambling, and taking fancy with regulars and
travellers.

Recently she has begun to tire of the mixing business and has been considering
closing the shop and applying to the [University](location:university-in-the-middle)
to study alchemy properly. She feels restless and is looking for an adventure
or distraction from her daily routine.
