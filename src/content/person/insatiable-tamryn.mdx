Tamryn is the Second of the largest troupe of psychedelic seers living in the
main village of the [Cult of the Hand](lore:cult-of-the-hand). Child of 2
generations of Seers, de has an alarmingly high tolerance for 
[seeing tea](lore:seeing-tea) and receives very strong and consistent visions,
but dir compatriots have become skeptical that the amount of tea de consumes is
producing legitimate insights. De takes things less seriously than others in
the troupe, delights in small things, enjoys teasing dir peers, and clashes
with troupe leader First Ria over matters of discipline.

<Embed.Meta>Life in the cult is even weirder than in the rest of Longbridge.
This style would be a trippy, dreamy, stream-of-consciousness tale with
little-to-no spoken dialogue, and not give away details easily.</Embed.Meta>
