Tattered strips of mycoleather hung heavy over the entrance to the sleeping
hut. Tamryn was at first aware of the sound of them snapping in the morningside
wind. Dir body was still, dir eyes remained closed as de slowly became
conscious. For several minutes, de lay motionless, a cool breeze flowing over
dir face, breathing slow and steady. This was peaceful. There was no memory, no
continuation of awareness from before sleep, only the present moment, with the
breeze, and the sounds, and the breath.

Distant voices carried on the breeze. Not speech, since members rarely found
the need for it, but the shrieking of children at play, the wordless, sing-song
chants of work poems, and occasional echoing laughter. Various of the tiny
animals which cohabited the Bridgehand with the members of the Cult scurried
and chittered in the corners of the hut. Footsteps outside the hut crunched on
the tangle, treading cautiously, and growing closer before stopping outside the
entrance. The visitor made a pitched humming sound; the pitch was the tone
which requested the attention of another listener.

_Are you there?_

Handelyn Tamryn resigned to the fact that de would have to commit to
wakefulness. At first, dir body was so completely relaxed, that it didn't
respond to dir intention to move. Slowly, de turned dir head away from the
bundle of soft fibres that sufficed for a pillow, spine cracking in resistance,
and peeled dir eyelids reluctantly apart.

First Ria stood at the hut entrance. She looked impatient.

Dir head immediately rang with a cacophany of tones and colours. De slammed
dir eyes shut again, but the ringing persisted. De grimaced and groaned.

First Ria spun around, lifting one wrist above her head, held the other in
front of her navel, and cocked her hips to strike a flamboyant pose.

_Ta-da!_

Uh, no, obviously not. Tamryn's soggy brain finally registered the glaring face
that went with the pose. De felt stupid. Obviously, it was:

_You will need clothes_

Confusing. Why clothes?

_Clothes?_, Tamryn intoned.

"Go to Workhome. For inputs." said Ria.

"Kel?" said Tamryn, and made the 'responsibility' pose with dir shoulders.
_Isn't it Kel's turn to go and get mixing stuff?_

First Ria assented. _To give us time to decide what to do with you_, she posed.
