Tattered strips of mycoleather hung heavy over the entrance to the sleeping
hut. Tamryn was at first aware of the sound of them snapping in the morningside
wind. Dir body was still, dir eyes closed, as de slowly became conscious. For
several minutes, de lay motionless, a cool breeze flowing over dir face,
breathing slow and steady. This was peaceful. There was no memory, no
continuation of awareness from before sleep, only the present moment, with the
breeze, and the sounds, and the breath.

Distant voices carried on the breeze. Not speech, since members rarely found
the need for them, but the shrieking of children at play, and the wordless,
sing-song chants of work poems, and occasional echoing laughter. Various of 
the tiny animals which cohabited the Bridgehand with the members of the Cult
scurried and chittered in the corners of the hut. Footsteps outside the hut
crunched on the tangle, treading cautiously, and growing closer before stopping
outside the entrance. The visitor made a pitched humming sound; the pitch was
the tone which requested the attention of another listener.

_Are you there?_

Handelyn Tamryn resigned to the fact that de would have to commit to
wakefulness. At first, dir body was so completely relaxed, that it didn't
respond to dir intention to move. Slowly, de turned dir head away from the
bundle of soft fibres that sufficed for a pillow, and peeled dir eyelids
reluctantly apart.

Dir head immediately rang with a cacophany of tones and colours. De slammed
dir eyes shut again, but the ringing persisted.
