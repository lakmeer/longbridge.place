Finder Jarek stood at the eveningside railing and let the morning wind blow
into his eyes. It was chilly in the shade of the apartment block at
51-tern-eveningside as several members of the Veil huddled in small groups,
shuffling their feet and muttering to each other in low voices. He sighed.
According to the Veiler he had spoken to, by report of the other residents of
this block, up to twenty-five citizens had been lost last night.

Jarek surveyed the wreckage of the back of the apartment. Starting at the
second floor, the entire back wall of the building was gone; the jagged edges
of the ruin framing the naked insides of the commonhouses with snapped mycowood
struts and crumbing panels of hash. On several floors, surviving citizens stood
at the broken edge of their formerly private quarters, clutching their
nightclothes around them against the wind while they gazed into the rolling
clouds beyond the eveningside railing.

Mycowood is a reasonable building material. It is cheap, light, and sturdy.
It finds ubiquitous use all over the city for creating vertical extensions
on top of existing buildings - a purpose for which is it quite well suited, all
parameters considered. Despite these favourable qualities, it is unarguably
inferior to the much stronger, denser, and scarcer arborial wood from the
gardens of Conservatory and the Keystone Presidium. It not very suitable,
for example, in highly leveraged, cantilevered structures which crane out over
uninhabited space, carrying their own weight in addition to the weight of the
structures they are supporting.

Unfortunately for the space-poor residents of Leans, arborial wood is more
or less unobtainable. Personal wealth is the lowest here of any enclave on
the bridge, and without a coherent Union to barter for better materials,
scraps of mycowood are the best that most can hope for. Overhangs, therefore,
are a phenomenally bad idea. Accidents such as this are not unheard of.

However, Finder Jarek is not convinced that this is an accident. Indeed, he
wouldn't be here if it was. 

As a pulser, one gains certain advantages. It takes a long time to learn the
knack of coupling.

Veil and Sky wasn't going to be much help, but Jarek thought it was nice that
they showed up anyway. Leans needs some kind of support.
