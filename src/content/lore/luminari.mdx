About the size of a large moth, Luminari are small luminous creatures that
resemble a blend between a jellyfish and a flower. They float indefinitely
thanks to an internal chamber that contains a [lighter-than-air gas](lore:lumin),
which is harvested from them to power [the street](lore:the-street)â€™s many
central [street lamps](lore:street-lamps). 

Luminari are extremely numerous year-round, and are seen both in sweeping
clusters beyond the railing of the bridge, and inside the city proper. Large
swarms are a spectacular sight at night, and luminari-watching is a popular
activity for [romantic dates](lore:courtship).
