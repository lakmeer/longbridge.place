Orothas weaves the story of Longbridge in real-time, deciding the outcomes of
people’s hopes and dreams, excluding their interactions with other people, who
make their own decisions. The story itself (everything that’s ever happened in
history) is called [The Book of Oro](lore:the-book-of-oro), or just **Oro**.
The contents of citizen’s personal thoughts are not committed to the Book of
Oro, nor are mundane details that are not worth reporting.

Citizens pray to Orothas for favourable outcomes to their endeavours, which
Orothas may or may not see fit to indulge. Not everything everyone wants is
compatible with the storyline. Citizens are aware that Orothas’ primary
responsibility is to tell the greatest story, not to guarantee their personal
successes, or even their personal safety.
