The bridge itself is of unknown age, but has been known and occupied for well
over 1000 years. Although itâ€™s age makes it appear extremely resistant to
damage, it [terminates](lore:the-broken-end) shortly after the 11-tern pillar
in a manner that is a clear indication of catastrophic damage, with no other
structure within visible range. [Bridgestones](lore:bridgestones) are harvested
for raw materials at the broken end where they have been loosened by the
damage.

The bridge is wide enough to contain two blocks of buildings, both edge
walkways, and the [central street](lore:the-street), which has two lanes
separated by a central ridge which is wide enough to walk on, and contains the
[street lamps](lore:street-lamps) at regular intervals.
