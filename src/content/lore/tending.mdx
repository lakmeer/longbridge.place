Citizens who are [raising children](lore:child-rearing) that they are not the
biological parent of - either as part of a [commonhouse](lore:commonhouses), or
otherwise - are assuming a cultural role known as ‘tender’. Tenders are
functionally the child’s parent and caregiver, and assume responsibility for
raising them while they are within their care.

Children will use the [title auxiliary](lore:auxiliary-names#titles) ‘Tender’
in the same way as they would call their biological parent ‘Mother’ or ‘Father’.
