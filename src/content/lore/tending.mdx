Citizens who are [raising children](parenting) that they are not the biological
parent of - either as part of a [commonhouse](commonhouses), or otherwise - are
assuming a cultural role known as ‘tender’. Tenders are functionally the
child’s parent and caregiver, and assume responsibility for raising them while
they are within their care. Children will use the [title auxiliary](auxiliary-names/titles) 
them ‘Tender’ as they would call their biological parent ‘Mother’ or ‘Father’.
