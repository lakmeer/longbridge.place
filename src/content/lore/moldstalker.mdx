A rare spider that lives in the Underneath; increasingly numerous the closer
one gets towards [the Bridgehand](lore:the-bridgehand). It appears to be a
mass of black, fuzzy mould, with a leathery membrane partially covering its
surface.

They are surprisingly intelligent, capable of complex pathfinding and apparent
co-operation with others. It moves through the world by extending thin
prehensile tendrils that drag its body. When attacking prey, it deflates
rapidly, expelling a cloud of spores that cause itchy, peeling welts on human
skin. Although dangerous to humans, it is said it is possible to bargain with
it by providing an alternative food source.
