#### “You can’t stand there” / “There’s no stones there”

#### “It’s a day to the ground” / “A day is a long time to regret”
From the colloquial belief that it takes a full day to fall from the bridge to

might as well wait until tomorrow and make the better decision. Also that,
hindsight will tell you exactly where you went wrong, but only too late.
