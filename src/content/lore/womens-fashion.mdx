Long hair, usually worn free at about shoulder length. Trousers are associated
with femininity and worn as pleated slacks with a crease, or tight-fit
stockings made of breathable fabric. Shirts are often puffy or frilly blouses,
worn under a long waistcoat that reaches below the hips. In cold weather, big
fluffy jumpers with tails and thick stockings are normal. 

Scarves worn with one end wrapped and one end hanging long are associated with
leadership and are common for women in positions of authority or
administration. Shoes are usually colourful flats with decorative embroidery or
textures.
