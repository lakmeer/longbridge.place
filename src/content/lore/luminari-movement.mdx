An [art](lore:art) and [fashion](lore:fashion) movement focused on developing
and showcasing unique or extravagant features in one's style or [gender
expression](lore:gender), culturally similar to drag. Named after the
ubiquitous [firefly-like creatures](lore:luminari) found all over Longbridge.

There is no consistent hair or fashion style. Exaggerated makeup and vibrant
colours are very common, and most luminari wear (a less ostentatious version
of) their style on a day-to-day basis. 

Luminari are associated with music and theatre, and the vast majority of
them reside in [Jubilee](location:jubilee) where dance performances are
popular.

Most luminari are women at about 50%, nymi about 35%, and a minority of men at
about 15%.
