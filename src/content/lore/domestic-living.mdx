Space is tight on the bridge, and the cultural norms surrounding living
arrangements are adapted appropriately. The most common types of dwelling found
in Longbridge are commonhouses, shophouses, family apartments and institutional
dormitories.

Structurally, the vast majority of homes are apartments in the many multi-story
buildings that line the Street. Standalone dwellings are very rare. A typical
apartment consists of a large, comfortable central room containing cooking
facilities and dining area, a bathroom providing running water and waste
plumbing, and several smaller rooms that connect to the central room, which are
usually used for private quarters or workshops. Larger or more lavish
apartments might have more side-rooms and a small anteroom for hanging coats
and shoes. Apartments are not always domestic dwellings and can be employed for
various purposes.
