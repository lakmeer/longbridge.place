Space is tight on the bridge, and the cultural norms surrounding living
arrangements are adapted appropriately. The most common types of dwelling found
in Longbridge are commonhouses, shophouses, family apartments and institutional
dormitories.

Structurally, the vast majority of homes are apartments in the many multi-story
buildings that line the Street. Standalone dwellings are very rare. A typical
apartment consists of a large, comfortable central room containing cooking
facilities and dining area, a bathroom providing running water and waste
plumbing, and several smaller rooms that connect to the central room, which are
usually used for private quarters or workshops. Larger or more lavish
apartments might have more side-rooms and a small anteroom for hanging coats
and shoes. Apartments are not always domestic dwellings and can be employed for
various purposes.

### Commonhouses
A commonhouse is occupied by a small group of usually unrelated, usually single adults.
Commonhouses are historically the traditional style of living practised by
citizens in Longbridge, both pre-dating the era of the Skybourne Pantheon, and
also endorsed by the Church at the time. Approximately 65% of Longbridge
citizens live in commonhouses.

### Shophouses
In commercial districts, apartment buildings will often have public-facing
shops on the ground floor, and residential apartments on the upper floors,
usually occupied by the group or family that owns or operates the shop.

### Family Lineages
Families as a living arrangement usually form around a multi-generational
family occupying the same apartment. Partners of family members will usually
move into the dwelling of the larger, older, or more prestigious family, and
children are more likely to spend more time at home compared to most.
Family-exclusive dwellings are a relatively recent evolution in the culture of
Longbridge, and a minority of living arrangements at about 10%.

### Dormitories
Several large institutions have on-site dormitories for members. These include:
- The [University in the Middle](the-univeristy-in-the-middle)
- The [Library of Eloryn](the-library-of-eloryn)
- The [Mint](the-mint)
- The [Temple of Solus (Assembly of Veil and Sky headquarters)](the-temple-of-solus)
- [Workhome](workhome)

### Child Rearing
Children tend to float freely around the households of their friends and
neighbours and are generally cared for by whoever happens to be around.
Children living and being raised in commonhouses happens relatively frequently,
either because their parents are deceased, are unable or not interested in
caring for the child, or occasionally just because the child prefers it. This
obviates the need for specific child-rearing institutions like orphanages and
creches.

Although there is no longer any kind of mandate to limit the number of
children, the cultural history of carefully limiting reproduction contributes
to a relatively low replacement rate. Citizens are typically very careful about
having unnecessary children. It is regarded as considerate and responsible to
have as few children as possible.
