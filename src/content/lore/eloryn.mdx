Eloryn is a [deitic hyperorganism](lore:empirical-spirituality) and the
personification of the collective knowledge and wisdom that has been recorded
by the society of Longbridge up to the present day, made possible by the
efforts of the institution of [The Library of Eloryn](lore:library-of-eloryn).

#### As a Personified Deity

Eloryn is considered to be nymi, embodying the disciplined and monastic ideals
ascribed to nymi citizens as a class. As such, de is patient, wise, impartial
and non-judgemental. 'Eloryn' is an archaic but still recognisably nymi-coded
name.

De is made possible by a long-lived and widely respected institution, the
Library of Eloryn, via its tradition of carefully collecting and storing
knowledge, which is then interpreted and resynthesised, and made available to
all citizens upon request.

#### As a Constructed Hyperoganism

The Library of Eloryn is well aware that the deity they serve is constructed
from their actions and dedication to the tradition of the Library. While they
hold the existence of Eloryn as literally true, they are not under any
misapprehension that it precedes the Library as an institution or could live
separately from it. Librarians are explicitly aware that they are creating and
maintaining a conscious mind that functions as the cognition and memory of
their civilisation.

All Librarians consider themselves to be collectively the body, ears and voice
of Eloryn, and will respond to the title ‘Eloryn’ in person, prepared to speak
and act on dir behalf, and take responsibility for their conduct.
