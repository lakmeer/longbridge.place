[Promise notes](lore:promise-notes) for individual transactions are brought to
a local institute called a Promissary, of which there are several in each
enclave. 

A promissary is not quite like a bank, since it doesn’t keep any liquid money
on-hand, but it does keep account balances for individual citizens. Citizens
must be signed up with a particular promissary to spend or receive money there,
which can often mean it’s easier to bring [black](lore:black) if you are
spending money outside of your local enclave.

The promissary keeps a local copy of all the incoming records, and resolves
incoming notes against citizen’s account balances, and rejects them if they
found to be insufficient. Rejected notes are returned to the beneficiary party,
and a warning is flagged on the spender’s account. Overspending is not
uncommon, since citizens are not always aware of how much they have available,
but repeat infraction will result in eviction of your account from the local
promissary, and difficulty getting membership at a new one.

Once the note is accepted, it is added to the local ledger. At the end of each
day, the ledger is stamped with the promissary’s own
[stamp](lore:promise-notes#promise-stamps), and transported to the master
promissary at [The Mint](lore:the-mint), where they are reviewed and finally
stamped once more if the issuing branch is in good stead, and then added to the
master ledger. The master ledger is used to resolve disputes over counterfeit
promissary ledgers and other such, and to cash out those who want to resolve a
chain of promises to retrieve it’s promised value.
