Families as a living arrangement usually form around a multi-generational
family occupying the same apartment. Partners of family members will usually
move into the dwelling of the larger, older, or more prestigious family, and
children are more likely to spend more time at home compared to most.
Family-exclusive dwellings are a relatively recent evolution in the culture of
Longbridge, and a minority of living arrangements at about 4%.
