Some presumably catastropic event which severed [the bridge](lore:the-bridge)'s
contact with [the ground](lore:the-ground), and thereby any other form of agency
outside of the bridge itself. The details of the event are lost to time; if it
was ever properly known, the knowledge was lost during the [Tribal
Era](lore:tribal-era), as a result of presumed widespread panic and infighting
following the event.

The Longbridge calender counts years starting at
roughly the time of this event, giving it the date of 'year zero'.
