A rememberer is a cutting-edge [machinette] constructed such that it captures
and re-emits sound vibrations with a time delay. It is essentially the
attrapulsive equivalent of an analog delay circuit.

### Function
Words spoken in the presence of the device are re-emitted after several
seconds, slowly attenuating until they fade over about 2 hours. Newer sounds
drown out older sounds, so it effectively repeats whatever it heard most
recently.

The field effect required to do this is extremely complicated, and takes months
for a group of skilled experts to construct a remembering device. Because of
the expense and difficulty, only three devices exist; one in a lab in Pulserâ€™s
Clave, where it was invented, one at the University, and one in the town square
in Mackintosh, donated by the current patriarch of the Mackintosh lineage,

### Appearance
The device has the appearance of a compact attrapulsive array under a
long, narrow stem with a large flat panel at the end, resembling a leaf. The
'leaf' of the device both detects and emits sounds.
