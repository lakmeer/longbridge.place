Auxiliary names are the set of names that come before one's
[facename](lore:facenames), and can change based on who is addressing you and
in what context.

There is rough agreement about the order in which names are applied, which
goes:

    Lineage name → [ all others in any order ] → Title name → Facename

Besides these conventions, there is not really a ‘correct’ way of addressing
someone, but amongst regular company, their day names are expected.

Auxiliary names don’t have to come from any of the below categories, and are
sometimes bespoke terms reflecting some prominent quality of the person as
reflected by their peers.

### Categories of Auxiliary Names

#### Title Names

Title names are the most common type of auxiliary to include when addressing
well-known people along with their facename, and usually reflect the direct
relationship currently being regarded between the two subjects. It is placed
closest to the facename in auxiliary order. Even among family members, it is
normal to use a title name, such as 'Father Soren'.

The default title for strangers is ‘Citizen’.

Note that ‘friend’, ‘peer’, etc are not eligible as title names - since
it is more proper to address one’s friends by their facename alone. The same
applies to intimate partners.

#### Lineage Names

Lineages are a tiny minority of familial structures in Longbridge, so lineage
names are very rare, but when they do apply, they come first in the list of
auxiliaries. Distinct from the ‘actual’ name of the family itself, the
‘lineage name’ is that name plus a suffix which declines based on the subject’s
gender:

- *-lin* for female subjects (pronounce "line")
- *-lyn* for nymi subjects
- *-lon* for male subjects
- *-land* when the subject’s gender is not known, or speaking abstractly

The female declination is most common due to the cultural tendency for
leadership duties to fall to women. In the cases where the suffix makes the
lineage name difficult to pronounce, the suffix sometimes replaces or is
blended into the last syllable of the family name.

  [ 'Abstract', '"Vierland Minter" -- this is akin to referring to a theoretical person, “whoever it is from the Vier family that runs the Mint”.' ],

#### Residential Names

A demonym derived from the name of the enclave, or relative direction where
they are currently residing, originated from or are most strongly identified
with. Residential names are typically in the form of an adjective.

#### Vocational Names

Similar to a title name, except that a vocational name describes what one
typically does for money or board, or a notable skill or practice, rather than
the direct relationship between them and the speaker.

Vocational names and titles names are often the same word, for example if
someone is both a vendor to you personally (sells to you regularly or is is
currently engaged in a transaction with you), and a vendor professionally in
general, you would call them ‘Vendor’ in both cases, but in one case you are
using their title name, and in the other their vocational name.

#### Deed Names

Deed names reflect notable achievements or (infamous misadventures) and are
usually used when talking about historical or mythical figures who are well
known for one specific trait or. Deed names are commonly phrased using the
present participle like ‘Singing’, or as an adjective like ‘Victorious’.

Deed names often tend towards being poetic or evocative rather than practical.
When using a deed name in combination with a residential name, the residential
name should be for the location at which to notable deed took place, rather
than the current (or final) place of residence of the subject.
