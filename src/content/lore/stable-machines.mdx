Stable machines are devices created by crafting and arranging [rods](lore:coupling-rods) into
specific configurations, producing attrapulsive effects without the need for a
pulser to couple with them. Sets of rods or other tools arranged in specific
patterns form attrapulsive arrays, which can create powerful or complex
effects. The use of stable machines and attrapulsive arrays can lead to
innovative architectural designs, and city-wide defenses based on attrapulsion.
Although simple, worn amplifiers are examples of stable machines.
