The Later Tree is a public-use 256-leaf [rememberer] in Mackintosh Square. It
is being used by citizens to leave messages to themselves or other citizens,
relying on listeners to recognise the voice of people they know. It was gifted
to the public square by the Mackintosh lineage in 997.

### Establishment

The Mackintosh lineage gifted the square this rememberer as a public utility in
997, not having any particular use in mind. Citizens werenâ€™t initally sure what
to make of it, but some have used it to record short messages for themselves or
others, and have taken to calling it the Later Tree.
