The Later Tree is a public-use 256-leaf [rememberer](lore:rememberer) in
[Mackintosh Square](location:mackintosh-square). It is used by citizens to
leave messages to themselves or others, relying on listeners to recognise the
voice of people they know. It was gifted to the square by the estate of the
Mackintosh lineage in 997 as a public service.
