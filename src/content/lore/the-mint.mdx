The Mint is a pre-split building in the [enclave](location:the-mint) of the
same name. The institution of The Mint was re-created from it's (presumed)
original pre-split roots to create and circulate [black](lore:black), and in
more recent times, to act as the [Master Promissary](lore:promissaries) which
tracks [promise](lore:promise-notes) transactions between citizens and other
commercial entities.


### The Vier Family

The Mint is owned, staffed and operated by the ancient family Vier and it’s
current matriarch, [Vierlin Black Mother Ylsyndra](person:black-ylsyndra).
The Vier family came into de-facto control of the Mint during
<Embed.Todo note="The Troubles" /> of the 780’s, although they had been well on
their way to becoming a formidable family dynasty even before that time. Since
[tantalum](lore:tantalum) poisoning is known to have detrimental effects on
one’s mental faculties, rumours of the strange and secretive behaviour of the
Vier family abound.
