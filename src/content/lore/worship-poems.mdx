The early [Cult of the Hand](lore:cult-of-the-hand-archaic) did not develop a
well-defined or structured mythology to ground it’s ceremonies and festivals.
Instead, devotees expressed their devotion by composing worship poems.

The two common forms of these were **day poems** -- simple rhythmic chants used
by workers during harvest -- and **dusk poems** -- long stories dramatising the
journey to [Workhome](location:workhome) and extolling life in Workhome
compared to [The Middle](lore:the-middle), performed publicly in the evenings.

This practice slowly evolved into the first traditions of
[musical culture](lore:music) in Longbridge, merging the day and dusk styles
into what is now known as [story form](lore:story-form). This began a tradition
of nightly revelry featuring fire, music, dancing, and intoxication (via an
earlier, much weaker form of the [psychedelic preparation](lore:seeing-tea)
used by the [modern remnants](lore:cult-of-the-hand) of the Cult of the
Hand) from which the modern culture derives many of it’s artistic and musical
influences.
