Men are somewhat expected to be proficient at physically demanding jobs and
skilled manual labour. They are overrepresented among builders, artisans,
attrapulsers, and Veil and Sky. As fathers, men are generally expected to
educate the children in academic, vocational and social skills. Men are
expected to maintain and fix things, especially buildings. Broadly, men are
somewhat expected to act as social peacekeepers and mediators. People in need
of equipment or repairs often find it reassuring to have a male artisan or
pulser.
