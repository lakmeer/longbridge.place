Citizens of Longbridge use an [absolute system of directions](lore:directions).
'Tern' is the direction along the bridge going right if you are
facing [morningside](lore:morningside), the edge of the bridge where
the sun rises.

At the far tern end of the bridge, the bridge [is destroyed](lore:the-broken-end),
and abruptly ends.
