A phase of fluid gender experimentation starting in late adolescence (age 10 -
13), and lasting until early adulthood (age 16- 20), during which young
citizens explore options for their gender expression before settling into
whatever feels comfortable.

This phase is typical and seen as healthy development. The end of juntari is
usually marked by a celebration with one's friends, and the ritual destruction
or disposal of clothing and other items which are no longer needed.

Although those ending their juntari are expected to adopt a concrete gender,
boundaries between the gender classes are not strongly policed by others, and
post-juntari fluidity is not often questioned.
