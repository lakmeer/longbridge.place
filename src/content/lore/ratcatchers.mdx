Ratcatchers are roughly cat-sized, stealthy, spider-like creatures fond of the
nooks and crannies of densely populated areas. They thrive with ready access
to small vermin and food scraps.

They can make their bodies extremely flat, and slip into surprisingly narrow
spaces easily. They are covered all over with a fine grey fur that is
surprisingly soft, and ratcatcher fur is used as a material in some styles of
clothing.

Despite being widely regarded as horrifying, and certainly capable of injuring
an adult human, ratcatchers are not usually aggressive towards humans unless
provoked, and attacks are very rare. A ratcatcher living in the gaps between
apartment buildings on your block is actually a very practical strategy for
managing vermin, if you can convince your neighbours to tolerate it.
