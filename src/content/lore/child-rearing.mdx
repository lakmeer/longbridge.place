Children tend to float freely around the households of their friends and
neighbours and are generally cared for by whoever happens to be around.
Children living and being raised in commonhouses happens relatively frequently,
either because their parents are deceased, are unable or not interested in
caring for the child, or occasionally just because the child prefers it. This
obviates the need for specific child-rearing institutions like orphanages and
creches.

Although there is no longer any kind of mandate to limit the number of
children, the cultural history of carefully limiting reproduction contributes
to a relatively low replacement rate. Citizens are typically very careful about
having unnecessary children. It is regarded as considerate and responsible to
have as few children as possible.
