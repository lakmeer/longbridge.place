The mythology of the [Order of Solus](lore:order-of-solus), now referred to as
the Skyborne Pantheon, was centred around a group of gods and goddesses who
presided over various aspects of life in the city. 

The Skyborne Pantheon was an integral part of daily life for the people of
Longbridge, with each deity having their own temples, rituals, and festivals.
The worship of these gods and goddesses focused on maintaining harmony with the
forces of nature and seeking their guidance and protection to ensure the
continued prosperity and safety of the city.

In the current era, the Skybourne Pantheon is regarded as an obsolete,
superstitious and complicated doctrine. It’s temples have largely been
repurposed to other functions, except for the largest, the [Grand Temple of
Solus](location:temple-of-solus) in Union, which serves as the headquarters and
ceremonial site for the modern day [Veil and Sky](lore:assembly-of-veil-and-sky-contemporary).
The main lasting imprint that this mythology has on the culture of Longbridge
is to provide the names used for the [months](lore:months) of the year, various
[idioms and sayings](lore:colloquial-idioms) that are still in common use, and
sometimes as [facenames](lore:facenames).

## Deities of the Skybourne Pantheon

#### Firis, God of the Sky

Ruled the heavens and provided the canvas against which the history of
Longbridge was played out, as well as the keeper of time, bringing the
inevitability of both life and death to the citizens of Longbridge. As a father
figure, Firis represents the responsibility of a father to ‘pull up’ their
children into the world - to raise and socialise them to thrive.

#### Nebura, Goddess of the Veil

  [ 'Dual', 'Firis' ],

The guardian of the ever-present blanket of cloud that rolled below the bridge,
shielding the city from the supposed horrors of below. Nebura was also credited
with the creation of the bridge itself, represented as the birth of Aurin, and
by extension all the people of Longbridge. As a mother figure, Nebura
represents the genesis of each individual person, and the responsibility of a
mother to protect their children’s health and physical wellbeing.

#### Selindra - Goddess of the Sun

She provided warmth and light to the people. Selindra represented life, light,
and daytime, and was dual with Valdor.

#### Valdor - God of the Moon

He governed the night and influenced the cycles of life, as well as providing a
soft, ethereal glow to guide the city's denizens in darkness. Valdor is dual
with Selindra.

#### Ganthor - God of the Winds

De ensured that the air was always flowing, providing the people with fresh air
and governing the weather, and representing valor, responsibility and taking
the high road in conflicts.

#### Rokan - God of Thunder
<Embed.Deflist rows={[
  [ 'Domain', 'Rain, Storms, Anger, Resentment' ],
  [ 'Dual', 'Ganthor' ],

He was a fearsome and powerful deity whose rage created mighty storms, and
representing resentment and revenge.

#### Elyssia - Goddess of the Stars
<Embed.Deflist rows={[
  [ 'Domain', 'The World Beyond, Wanderlust, Luminari' ],
  [ 'Dual', 'Nymira' ],

She represented the mystery of the world beyond the bridge, and wanderlust of
adventure into the unknown, offering guidance and wisdom to those who sought
it. Elyssia was said to be manifest in the form of the swarms of luminari found
everywhere in Longbridge.

#### Nymira - Goddess of Dreams
<Embed.Deflist rows={[
  [ 'Domain', 'The Inner Self, Dreams, Introspection' ],
  [ 'Dual', 'Elyssia' ],
]} />

The keeper of the subconscious, provided solace and guidance through dreams and
visions to the people of Longbridge, and embodied solitude, calm, and the value
of introspection.

##### Aurin - Child of the Bridge

Not really considered a full deity in dir own right, Aurin was the
personification of the bridge itself, birthed by Nebura into the world, and
raised up to the heavens by Firis. As a representation of a child, de was not
attributed any particular sphere of responsibility and mainly existed to
establish the importance of ‘protection’ in the familial archetype of Firis and
Nebura, and as such, didn't have a dual. To the extent that Aurin embodied any
particular concepts, it would be precarity and vulnerability, since the bridge
is seen as exposed to the elements, and reliant on appropriate support to thrive.

### Dualities

The Skybourne Pantheon was structured in a system of nested ‘duals’. When each
deity was paired with another, that pairing was paired with another, and so on.
Each pairing had spiritual significance on top of that provided by each
individual deity. The final pairing, known as Solus, represented the unity of
the cosmos, although it did not have a personification or specific sphere of
dominion.

#### Firis and Nebura
Said to be in a relationship with each other because they meet at the horizon.
Their relationship was perceived as ideal, and they supported each other. Their
duality represented parenthood, connection, and enduring love. Embodying the
ideal parental archetype, Firis provided safety during the day and Nebura at
night. The duality of Firis and Nebura reminded citizens that the family was
built upon the close cooperation of both parents to provide stability and
protection to their children.

#### Valdor and Selindra
It was said that they were in a mutually unrequited relationship, each one
chasing the other across the sky, never catching up and therefore never able to
have their desire fulfilled. The duality of Valdor and Selindra represented
tragedy, separation, and longing, and gives rise to the idiom ["chasing
Veldor/Selindra"](lore:idioms#chasing-veldor--chasing-selindra).

#### Ganthor and Rokan
It was said that they were brothers engaged in a bitter, eternal feud. Rokan
was scheming, ever trying to dispatch rain and storms to disrupt Ganthor’s
peace and undermine his authority. He was seen as fallen and misled due to his
obsession with revenge. Ganthor was seen as taking the high road of forgiveness
and tolerance, and dir mature approach brought stability and tranquillity. The
duality of Ganthor and Rokan represented the souring of formerly fond
relationships, the seduction of revenge, and the way that rising above
squabbles yields more favourable conditions for everyone.

#### Elyssia and Nymira
It was said that they complemented each other; Elyssia, the outward quest for
knowledge and the bravery to face the unknown, and Nymira, the inward quest to
understand one’s self and the mysteries that lie within. Their duality
represented the balance between seeking external adventures and internal
understanding, between relying on others and improving oneself, and between
laying the blame for misfortune on the world and one’s own deeds. The duality
of Elyssia and Nymira reminded citizens that reward is found on both the inward
and outward journeys of the soul.
