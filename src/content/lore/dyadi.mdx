Dyadi is the collective term for the two [gender classes](lore:gender) that
Longbridge citizens think of as ‘men’ and ‘women’ The term dyadi is not
frequently used, instead all 3 classes are usually spoken of equally. Dyadi are
contrasted with Nymi sometimes with respect to their role in rasing families,
or their reputation for a higher level of sexual activity.
