‘Return’ is the practice of throwing people off the bridge as a form of
[capital punishment](lore:capital-punishment). Although this was practised
widely and haphazardly during the [Tribal Era](lore:tribal-era), it was not
known as ‘return’ until after its reinstatement as a method of punishment
authorised by the [Exalted Order of Solus](lore:order-of-solus), who --
having previously banned the practice -- reintroduced it in an attempt to
regain control over an increasingly dissatisfied populace. The Order would
“return citizens to [Nebura](lore:nebura)”, a reference to the goddess of 
[the clouds](lore:the-cloud-sea) below the bridge in the mythology of the
Order.

Although the mythology has lapsed from popularity in the hundreds of years
since the dissolution of the Order, the term itself has stuck around to
describe the crime of throwing people over the edge of the bridge, which
happens most commonly as a result of interpersonal disputes or intoxication,
rather than an institutional form of punishment.
