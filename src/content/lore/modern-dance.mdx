The popular form of music enjoyed today in Longbridge is derived from the
‘dance’ section of [story form](lore:story-form#dance), and features a much
more regular meter with fewer time changes, and most often exhibits a crescendo
beginning with a relatively low-energy rendition of the song’s theme, which
builds to the ‘dance’ proper.

This buildup is repeated 2 or more times in each performance. Modern dance
style retains some other features from story form, which is unsurprising since
it the earliest form of music and very influential on all musical styles of the
bridge. Some retained features of story form include:

- Slipping between 3-count and 2-count versions of the same tempo
- Triplet swing feel
- Audience vocalising in simple, memorable chants

Despite retaining some recognisable features, modern dance style is much more
variable and flexible in how songs are constructed. Songs are usually in a
2-count timing with even meter length, and unlikely to change meter length
during the same song. Performers will often curate songs to have compatible
keys and tempos, and will perform the set continuously, letting each song
smoothly blend into the next, or fill the gaps with musical elaborations
by solo performers.
