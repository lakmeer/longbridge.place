Any result of the deliberate effort of a pulser, usually using a 
[coupling rod](lore:coupling-rods) or [stable-machine](lore:stable-machines).
Effects usualy relate to the remote manipulation of objects.

### Basic effects
Effects available even to beginners.

##### Hopping
A ‘hop’ is a beginner’s first attempt at kinesis, which is what new pulsers
typically learn first. The target objects jumps, jolts or skips a short
distance as a results of being reached by a short uncontrolled surge of
attrapulsive energy. Hopping is actually quite hard to do, and is where most
beginners expect to plateau for a long time during their education.

### Intermediate effects
Known effects available to a skilled practitioner.

##### Kinesis
Manipulating objects, allowing for lifting, rotation, or projectiles.

##### Repulsion shield
Creating an invisible barrier that repels objects or projectiles, acting as a
defensive measure.

##### Binding
Using attrapulsion to keep objects or people stuck together, restricting
movement or immobilising targets.

##### Signalling
Transmitting messages or information by creating strong attrapulsive
[echoes](lore:attrapulsive-echoes) that can be sensed by a remote pulser.

##### Channelling
Redirecting attrapulsive energy from an external source through a conduit of
some attrapulsive material, usually to build stable machines, or temporarily
boost the power of one's own abilities.

##### Environmental control
Using attrapulsion to influence weather patterns or control the movement of air
or water, potentially for agriculture or climate management purposes.

### Advanced effects
Difficult, complex or dangerous abilities only available to high level pulsers.

##### Levitation
Lifting objects or people, and maintaining a stable position above the ground.
Levitating objects is very difficult and requires practice to maintain balance.
Levitating people is not illegal but it is quite dangerous and isn’t commonly
attempted even by experienced pulsers.

##### Shuddering
Violently shaking a target back and forth rapidly, causing structural damage or
injury. Shuddering is extremely illegal.

##### Feedback
Exploiting the coupling between a rod and it’s user to cause overexertion in
the user’s brain. Feedback happens naturally, but the ability to exploit it
deliberately is a high-level skill. Intentionally inflicting feedback isn’t
specifically illegal, but it constitutes a form of assault, which is.
