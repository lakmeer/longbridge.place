Devotees of the Hand lived near the boundary of the Bridgehand around the
10-firthan pillar in a community of makeshift villages and huts known as
[Workhome](location:workhome), which would gradually evolve to become the
modern enclave of the same name.

Following the discovery of the Bridgehand, and having suffered under the
precarity and oppression of the [Order of Solus](lore:order-of-solus) in
it’s later years, citizens began leaving [The Middle](location:the-middle) in
droves and worshipping the abundance of the Bridgehand.

The Bridgehand was seen as a divine intervention, sent to break the
Order’s stranglehold of enforced scarcity. It was hailed as a timely and
generous benefactor to Longbridge, since it greatly increased the available
food and other resources.

Tensions broke out into violent conflicts as the Order tried to stop it’s
members abandoning them for the Bridgehand, even going as far as to stage raids
on the encampments of devotees of the Hand to terrorise and “save” them by
kidnapping them back to The Middle to serve penance and learn from their moral
errors to become “proper citizens”.
