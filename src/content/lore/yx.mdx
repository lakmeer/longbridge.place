Yx is the universe itself and everything in it doing its universe thing. It’s
not aware or agentive, just a clockwork device that produces the next moment of
reality from the previous ones. Yx is not regarded as a ‘creator god’ or prime
mover, a concern about which the culture of Longbridge doesn’t have a coherent
opinion. The origin of the universe remains mysterious, but the fact that it is
here at all serves as adequate evidence for Yx’s existence, and is trivial to prove.
