Citizens of Longbridge are addressed by a variable number of ‘auxiliary’ names
and one ‘facename’, all of which can change over the course of their lifetimes
or between different groups of peers.

### Social Etiquette and Exceptions

- It’s not wrong to use more names than necessary, but it is rude to use fewer
  names than you are entitled to. 
  - Exception: with intimate partners or friends, using more names is considered distant or passive-aggressive.
- It is weird to try to assert your own name, rather than earn it from each peer group. 
  - Exception: when a child wants to create their own facename.
- It is rude to omit the facename of someone you are directly talking to. 
  - Exception: when you are in a temporary interaction where names are not known or necessary, such as talking to a shopkeeper or customer.
