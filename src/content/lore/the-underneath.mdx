The Underneath is a series of sewers and service tunnels built into the
stonework of the bridge. It also contains large water cisterns that collect
fresh rainwater, located inside the major pillars. Buildings built on the
surface of the bridge can evacuate waste into the sewer tunnels of the
underneath via portholes that are placed at regular intervals.

The tunnels of the Underneath are variously narrow and winding, or broad and
cavernous. It is home to it's own unique ecosystem of plants and animals.
Unlike the street above, the tunnels are not laid out in a regular or
consistent way along the length of the bridge.
