Exile is a social practice used as a method of last resort in solving domestic
disharmony in commonhouse living, where residents can be expelled by majority
vote. If a unanimous agreement is reached among those of the affected party,
the offending party is expected to pack their things and leave immediately. 

Failure to comply is a serious social transgression that publicly marks the
offending party as an antisocial troublemaker, and they will find their life
considerably harder afterwards. For this reason, it is not unknown for citizens
to maintain at least two circles of friends such that they will not be left
without a place to stay if they find themselves on the losing end of an exile
vote.

Those with no other place to go can stay for a short time at the [Assembly
of Veil and Sky](lore:assembly-of-veil-and-sky), but are expected to either
join, or move on to another arrangement within a few days.
