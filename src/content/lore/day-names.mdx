Once a citizen is [of-age](lore:juntari), it is likely that their primary peer
groups will have settled on a fairly stable set of names that are known and
used by regularly by almost everyone they know. This process is called ‘earning
one’s names’, and the set that results are their ‘day names’. 

The vast majority of people will go by one auxiliary, usually an adjective,
giving them two day names. People of notable status or fame will sometimes have
3 or more day names. It is considered improper to try to choose one’s own day
names, similarly to how trying to give yourself a nickname at school never goes
well. Day names are not always proper auxiliaries, depending on what happens
to stick.
