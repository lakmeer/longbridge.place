Beyond the end of [Far Echo](location:far-echo), the end of the bridge is
destroyed. The commonly accepted story is that it was destroyed by a meteor
strike, but this doesnâ€™t explain the missing far side of the bridge.
Bridgestones are harvested here for building materials and aurum.

Nothing can be seen over the clouds beyond the crumbing end, but rumours of a
[distant _something_](lore:beyond) that can be seen on a clear day are as old
as the bridge itself.
