Women are somewhat expected to be organised and capable of directing a group of
people. They are overrepresented in administration and Citizen’s Union
positions, mixers, and doctors. As mothers, women are generally expected to
care for the physical health of the children, including diet and medical care.
Because medicine is primarily based in alchemy, mixing is associated with
motherhood (except in university research where it’s considered academic), and
there is a stereotype of older women knowing secret recipes and clever mixing
tricks to cure obscure ailments. People in need of medical attention often find
it reassuring to have a female doctor or mixer.
