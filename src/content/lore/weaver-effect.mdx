It has long been known that fluxweavers construct traps for their prey,
consisting of a ring of a concrete-like substance regurgitated by the animal,
which sets in a roughly circular pattern. Prey become fixated in a spot
projected in front of the center of the circle, seemingly without physical
interference, called the 'weaver effect'. Historically, this was assumed to be
due to some kind of hypnosis, due to the strange acute headaches that people
experience when near a fluxweaver trap. However, [Learned Pac](lore:history-of-attrapulsion)
discovered that the effect also works when the fluxweaver is absent, and on
small inanimate objects. This lead to a closer study of the substance the trap
is made of, revealing an effect intrinsic to the material itself.

For several years, experiments had to be done by collecting fluxweaver traps
for raw materials, but it was eventually discovered that fluxweavers create the
material by ingesting bridgestones, concentrating the mineral now known as
[apacite](lore:apacite), and regurgitating a thick paste which sets firm.
After this discovery, [University alchemists](lore:academic-alchemy) began
extracting apacite directly from harvested bridgestones, and have gone on to
discover several other [attrapulsive materials](lore:attrapulsive-materials).
