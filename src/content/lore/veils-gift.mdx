A rare flower not native to the bridge which seems to have originted from a
seed that drifted into [Keystone](location:keystone-fortress) 
[presidium](lore:presidium) accidentally. It grows in small tufts of straight
leaves, with a single flower of one large curved petal, with a pale orange
colour.
