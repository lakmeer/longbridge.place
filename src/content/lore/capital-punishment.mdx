In the [Enlightenment Era](lore:enlightenment-era), capital punishment is
outlawed everywhere on the bridge. In earlier times, especially before the
emergence of the [Exalted Order of Solus](lore:order-of-solus) in the
[Tribal Era](lore:tribal-era), mob justice was commonplace. Due to sheer
convenience, [return](lore:return) was the most common form of capital
punishment.
