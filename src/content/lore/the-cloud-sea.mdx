The bridge stands above a persistent, impenetrable layer of cloud. The height
of the cloud layer is variable depending on conditions, but in clear weather is
on average about 50 meters below the surface of the bridge. The cloud layer is
subject to rolling swells that move like waves, which in strong winds can
sometimes wash over the whole city, covering everything with dew and reducing
visibility to a few meters. These can last hours to days depending on conditions. 

Although the city is mostly above the cloud layer, higher clouds do form
regularly and occasional rain and storms are possible. Storms are particularly
damaging since most newer structures are made of weaker materials, and
unregulated construction is usually done without consideration to storms
because they are relatively rare. At night, the top of the cloud layer is
sometimes illuminated with flashes of lightning as storms rage below.

In older mythologies of Longbridge, the cloud layer is a primary metaphysical
component of the world, acting in opposition or duality with the sky. In the
mythology of the [Exalted Order of Solus](lore:order-of-solus), the clouds are
known as [Nebura](lore:nebura), a mother figure who birthed the bridge upwards
out of the clouds.
