Citizens of Longbridge use an absolute system of directions.

'[Morningside](lore:morningside)' is the edge of the bridge facing the
direction of sunrise, and is considered the primary direction.

'[Firthan](lore:firthan)' is the direction going left when facing this
direction, and '[tern](lore:tern)' or '[ternwards](lore:tern)' is the direction to the
right.

'[Eveningside](lore:eveningside)' is the opposite edge of the bridge.

Less common are the relative terms ‘inward’ and 'outward', meaning toward or
away from [The Middle](location:the-middle), respectively.
