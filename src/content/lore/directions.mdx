Citizens of Longbridge use an absolute system of directions. 'Morningside' is
the edge of the bridge facing the direction of sunrise, and is considered the
primary direction. 'Firthan' is the direction going left from this position,
and 'tern' or 'ternwards' is the other direction. Eveningside is the opposite
edge of the bridge.

Less common are the relative terms ‘inward’ and 'outward', meaning toward or
away from the Middle, respectively.
