A hallucinogenic mix prepared from the Seer's slime found in the Underneath
below the Bridgehand. It is used by members of the Cult of the Hand
to [induce visions](lore:the-cult-of-the-hand#seeing-ceremonies) in
which they attempt to communicate with the Bridgehand.

Consumed raw, Seerâ€™s slime will make you very ill, but it can be alchemically
prepared into a psychedelic tincture. The preparation concentrates the slime by
a large factor, and mitigates most of the ill effects of the raw slime, but is
still very unpleasant to taste, and is an off-putting opaque yellow-brown
colour due to the alchemical treatment.
