The ancient and mysterious city of Longbridge is built upon a colossal stone
bridge spanning roughly one thousand kilometers. No-one knows how it got there,
and there is no recorded history before contact was lost with the ground,
nearly 1000 years ago. At one end it is engulfed in a colossal, multicoloured
fungus; a critical source of food and materials. At the other, it terminates
suddenly, destroyed by events just as unknowable as the origin of the bridge
itself.

Below the bridge rolls a persistent, impenetrable sea of white clouds,
stretching all the way to the featureless horizon and blocking any view of the
ground. Many have tried to journey below, but of course, none have returned.

In the city, nearly 250,000 citizens bustle between the haphazard buildings
that line both sides of the central street. Several stories tall and presenting
in a colourful variety of architectural styles, these city blocks are grouped
into enclaves, each one with itâ€™s own local culture and history. 

From the ancient art of alchemy to the newfangled technology of attrapulsion -
as well as the timeless human staples of art, romance, commerce and crime - the
unique culture and technology continues to adapt to the needs and moods of
daily life here in Longbridge, the city above the clouds.
