The ancient and mysterious city of Longbridge is built upon a vast stone bridge
spanning roughly one thousand kilometers. It is not known how it got there, and
there is no recorded history before [contact was lost](lore:the-split) with the
ground, nearly 1000 years ago. At [one end](lore:firthan) it is engulfed in a
[colossal, multicoloured fungus](lore:the-bridgehand); a critical source of
[food and materials](lore:products-of-the-bridgehand). At [the other](lore:tern),
it terminates suddenly, [destroyed](lore:the-broken-end) by events just as
unknowable as the origin of [the bridge itself](lore:the-bridge).

Below the bridge rolls a persistent, impenetrable 
[sea of white clouds](lore:the-cloud-sea), stretching all the way to the
featureless horizon and blocking any view of [the ground](lore:the-ground).
Many have tried to journey below, but of course, none have returned.

In the city, nearly 250,000 [citizens](lore:citizens) bustle between the
haphazard [buildings](tag:buildings) that line both sides of the central
[street](lore:the-street). Several stories tall and presenting in a colourful
variety of [architectural styles](lore:architecture), these city blocks are
grouped into [enclaves](/map), each with itâ€™s own local culture and history.

From the ancient art of [mixing](lore:mixing) to the newfangled technology of
[attrapulsion](lore:attrapulsion) - as well as the timeless human staples of
[art](lore:art), [romance](lore:courtship), [commerce](lore:commerce) 
and [crime](lore:justice) - the unique culture continues to adapt to the needs
and moods of daily life here in Longbridge, the city above the clouds.
