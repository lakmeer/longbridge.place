Young women will often decorate each otherâ€™s shoes as a bonding activity, and
finely decorated shoes are a signifier that one has a lot of friends. Decorated
shoes are worn with pride even well into adulthood. Popular styles involve
intricate embroidery with curling, organic filigree and floral motifs.
