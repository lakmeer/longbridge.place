Quite some distance into the thicket of the Bridgehand, a colony of a few
hundred people live in a small makeshift village. This is the Cult of the Hand,
the remnants of a previous religious sect worshipping the Bridgehand for it’s
bountiful resources, now a small commune of naked hippies that attempt to
commune with it in thier psychedelic ceremonies. They don’t often find
themselves with visitors.

### Culture

People living here are known as ‘members’ rather than ‘citizens’ and take the
[lineage name](lore:auxiliary-names#lineage-names) Handeland.
Members mostly refrain from speaking verbally, and communicate to the extent
necessitated by their simple lifestyle using gesture and a system of sing-song
tones which has been preserved from the older tradition of worship poems, and
extensively documented by [Eloryn](lore:eloryn). Members believe the Bridgehand is sentient
and intelligent, and attempt to communicate with it using seeing tea, a
hallucinogenic mix derived from the seer’s slime found in the Underneath.
Despite lack of direct evidence, they are actually correct; the Bridgehand is
in fact intelligent and attempting to influence their visions.

### Seer Troupes

Seeing ceremonies are conducted in troupes; small groups of about ten lead by
one person known as First, assisted by one or two Seconds whose expertise is in
preparing the seeing tea. Each ceremony begins and ends with a song, and
consists of all seers sitting in a particular arrangement, consuming the tea,
followed by a discussion of the visions lead by the First in which they try to
piece together a coherent picture of the Bridgehand’s intentions. Apart from
coordinating the group, First’s job is to assemble, revise and remember this
picture, and propose methods of communicating back to the Bridgehand. Seer
Troupes may be started and joined by anyone, and there are currently three or
four regular troupes, with the oldest and largest troupe being the most active.
