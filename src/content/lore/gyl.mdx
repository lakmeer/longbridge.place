Gyl reads the [Book of Oro](lore:the-book-of-oro) and the 
[library of Eloryn](lore:eloryn), witnessing the past and present deeds of the
citizens of Longbridge, and passing its judgement upon them.

Unlike other modern deities, Gyl is an entity external to Longbridge, and
cannot pass information into the world, or influence the world directly.
However, the mere fact of its existence tends to make citizens more self-aware
of their behaviour, and motivates them to behave in accordance with being seen
in a better light.

Citizen’s impression of Gyl is vaguely adversarial and suspicious, and prayers
to Gyl usually take the form of atonement for something bad they have done.
Others, aware that Gyl has no means of delivering any consequences, simply
don’t particularly care what it thinks of them. These people are known as
‘[unclothed](lore:unclothed)’, including among themselves, since they live
in the "eye of Gyl" without shame.
