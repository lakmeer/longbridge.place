Makren is a very wealthy and established family lineage dating back at least
400 years, which founded (or at least consolidated) the 
[Makren enclave](location:makren) on the 4-tern pillar. It has held almost
complete control over the enclave of Makren, and forms the entire membership
of the Makren [Citizen's Union](lore:citizens-unions). Despite this rare level
of control, the Makren lineage is relatively well-liked by the residents of
Makren as the stewards of their enclave.
