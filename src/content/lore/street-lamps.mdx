In the middle-most few enclaves, [the street](lore:the-street)'s central ridge
is studded with street lamps at regular intervals. These are a relatively
recent invention, relying on attrapulsive technology for their illumination.

The lamps are fed [lumin gas](lore:lumin) via a system of pipes installed into
[the underneath](lore:the-underneath), which collects in a
[mycoglass](lore:products-of-the-bridgehand#mycoglass) bulb at the top of the
post and stimulated to emit light by a [stable machine](lore:stable-machines).
