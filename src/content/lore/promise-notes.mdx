To combat the lack of liquidity in the circulation of black (and to avoid
having to touch them too much) most of commerce in Longbridge is conducted with
a complicated system of authority-backed I-owe-you notes that forms a sort of
hybrid barter and currency system.

A note is similar to a bank note or cheque in that it is in-principle worth an
equivalent amount of [black](lore:black) directly. Each one records the names
and stamps of both parties to the transaction, what has been exchanged, and the
date, and is validated by the local [promissary](lore:promissaries).

The beneficiary of a note keeps the physical note and is also expected to
provide the blank at the start (it is considered ‘their’ note). The spender
sometimes receives a smaller receipt note that also has both stamps. Promise
and receipt notes are available as little tear-out booklets, like a chequebook,
and are quite affordable, but any piece of paper with the right details and
stamps will be accepted.

### Promise Stamps

Each individual citizen, place of business, and level of authority in the
promise system, has a unique ink stamp which is used to authorise a note.
Making stamps is a skillful and venerated vocation, and it costs a fair bit to
get one made, but citizens can and do make their own, since even amateurishly
made stamps can be difficult to forge accurately. The ink is made from a simple
mixture of candle black and brightslime.

Each step of authorisation on a promise note has it’s own stamp: the buyer, the
seller, the place of business (if any), the local promissary, and the master
promissary at [The Mint](lore:the-mint).
