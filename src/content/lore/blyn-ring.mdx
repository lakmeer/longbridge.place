The Blyn Ring is the simplest proper [stable machine](lore:stable-machines),
and is created by stacking smaller lengths of extruded synthetic weaver paste
together in a circle, instead of using one long extruded segment. Named after
Learned Weaver Blyn, an early University researcher in the nascent field of
attrapulsion.

This created a slightly stronger pinning effect, able to hold a person’s hand
in place with noticeable resistance. This was understood as a ‘self reinforcing
trap’, where the subtraction effects overlap and reinforce each other, rather
than cancelling each other out. This phenomena is very sensitive to
misalignment of the materials.
