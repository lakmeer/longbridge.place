Large, black [tantalum](lore:tantalum) coins created and circulated by [The
Mint](lore:the-mint), whose original supply pre-dates [the split](lore:the-split).

The coins are a tantalum alloy that oxidises to a shiny black colour shortly
after production. The oxide layer both gives the coins itâ€™s characteristic
appearance, and also (mostly) protects users from the 
[mild toxicity](lore:tantalum#tantalum-poisoning) of the tantalum metal.
Despite the layer of protection, the black oxide has a strong metallic smell
that stains the skin, and most people do not enjoy handling the coins.

The supply of black is limited, since new sources of tantalum are rare, and
coins are slowly cannibalised to obtain tantalum for mixing. The current total
number of coins is not known, but many are hoarded by wealthier citizens and
old families. As a result, the value of black slowing increases, and is currently
too high for it to be a functional currency for everyday needs in Longbridge.
This shortcoming has given rise to the current system of 
[promise notes](lore:promise-notes).
