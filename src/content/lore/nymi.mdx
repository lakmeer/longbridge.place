Nymi is a nonbinary gender comprising about 15% of the population, and is a
well accepted and integrated social class in Longbridge. Nymi are thought of as
a sort of bridge between the masculine and feminine, and [all classes](lore:gender)
borrow [fashion](lore:fashion) or presentation styles from each other to
position themselves comfortably on this spectrum. The nymi equivalent of
'masculine' or 'feminine' is 'niadine'.

Nymi include biologically intersex ("nymale") people, although they
are a statistically small population. Most nymi have sexually dimorphic body
types and identify as such, unless by personal preference.

#### Social Expectations

Nymi are somewhat expected to have a specialised interest to dedicate their
career to. They are overrepresented in academic and monastic pursuits like
[history](lore:history), [research](location:university-in-the-middle) and
[astronomy](lore:astronomy), and are respected as authorities in their fields.
Students and apprentices often find it reassuring to have a nymi professor or
mentor.

Although many nymi will have children, they are not normally associated with
parenthood in the same way that [dyadi](lore:dyadi) are; their social
responsibilities relate to older children, such as training them in higher
education or specialised vocations. They are statistically less likely to form
long term relationships and start families, often living in commonhouses with 
3 - 4 other single adults long term.
