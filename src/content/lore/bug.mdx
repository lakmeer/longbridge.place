Domesticated, sightless slugs about the size of a large rat. Featureless except
for small holes at front or rear. Itâ€™s hard to tell which way around they are.
They are bred to enrich organic waste into a very effective fertiliser for
agricultural substrate. The bugpits are an unenviable place to work.
