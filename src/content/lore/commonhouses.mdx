A commonhouse is occupied by a small group of usually unrelated, usually single
adults. Commonhouses are historically the traditional style of living practised
by citizens in Longbridge, both pre-dating the era of the Skybourne Pantheon,
and also endorsed by the Church at the time. Approximately 65% of Longbridge
citizens live in commonhouses.
