The last remnants of an [older religious institution](lore:assembly-of-veil-and-sky)
of Longbridge, The Assembly of Veil and Sky, or more commonly just 'Veil and
Sky', is a voluntary organisation that spans all enclaves of the bridge.

Members of the modern Veil and Sky preserve the older traditions and values by
doing acts of good will in the city; most notably providing a volunteer
pseudo-police force which intervenes to prevent citizens becoming violent or
disruptive.

Members of Veil and Sky are identifiable by their archaic religious uniforms
and unwaveringly polite and accommodating demeanour. They are often spotted
patrolling the street at night, particularly in more dangerous enclaves. The
modern organisation keeps their headquarters in the Grand Temple of Solus, in
[Union](location:union).
