Coupling rods are the basic tools used by pulsers to create
[attrapulsive effects](lore:attrapulsive-effects). They are made from refined
attrapulsive materials, and are typically thin, straight, metallic objects,
about 4-10 inches long, but can be other shapes. Rods are used by mentally
coupling to the rod material through a technique called [attunement](lore:attrapulsion#attunement-and-dampening)
that must be developed over years of dedicated study and practice.

High-quality rods used by experienced pulsers are often decorated with unique
relief designs. The orientation of the rod determines the
[valence](lore:attrapulsion#valence) of the effect. Advanced rods or other
tools can be created which allow pulsers to switch valence rapidly, enabling
more complex effects and techniques. Coupling objects are not always
rod-shaped; other styles of coupling objects are called amplifiers —- usually
gauntlets, bracelets, rings, neckbands or diadems -— which enhance the user’s
coupling strength.
