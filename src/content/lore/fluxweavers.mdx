A unique kind of spider that lives in [the Underneath](lore:the-underneath).
Unlike [ratcatchers](lore:ratcatchers), fluxweavers construct traps to catch
their prey. They excrete a thick paste that dries hard, and exhibits
attrapulsive properties. The structure built by a fluxweaver is essentially a
natural stable machine, creating a [ring effect](lore:attrapulsion) that pins
small animals that wander into the effect range. Fluxweaver traps are the way
in which [attrapulsion was first discovered](lore:history-of-attrapulsion).
