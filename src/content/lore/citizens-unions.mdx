In almost every enclave, the Citizen's Union is the predominant form of
governance on the bridge. Each enclave differs in the manner in which it
operates its CU, but the basic structure is the same; CU representatives are
sent to negotiate for the interests of the enclave and its residents by
participating in the [city administration](lore:city-administration) at
[Keystone fortress](location:keystone-fortress) in [The Middle](location:the-middle).

### Leans Exception
The enclave of [Leans](location:leans) is currently too chaotic to have a
functioning CU. There are several competing efforts to create one, which is
itself part of the problem.
