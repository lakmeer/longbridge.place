Attrapulsion was initially discovered in 950 by University zoologist Learned
Weaver Pac during his study of [fluxweavers](lore:fluxweavers).

## Initial Discovery

Despite mostly focusing his academic career on zoology, Learned Pac is widely
credited as the “father of attrapulsion”, and was the foremost expert on the
weaver effect during his lifetime.

## Early rods

As the study of the ‘weaver effect’ developed, techniques for producing
attrapulsive materials improved. It turned out that the mixture produced by
fluxweavers is a more effective attrapulsive material than pure refined
apacite. This is known as weaver’s paste, and is a mixture of mainly apacite,
aurum, and whitestone.

Coupling was discovered as a result of the study of the medical effects of
proximity to fluxweaver traps. The headache usually experienced was also
induced when the fluxweaver was not present, and so the study of weaver’s paste
itself lead to the discovery of the coupling effect.

Early coupling objects were made from a synthetic analogue of weaver’s paste
produced as an extrusion, and broken into chunks for use in experiments.
Experimenters found that even the synthetic material was giving them headaches,
until the first accidental hopping event occurred and researchers could begin
to narrow in on what was happening.

It was at this point that the field of attrapulsion really developed as it is
known today. After researchers began to be able to reliably reproduce hopping
through mental effort, the theory of ‘material resonance’ was put forward as
the best explanation of the phenomenon.  

## Invention of Stable Machines

As higher quality materials became available, researchers attempted to
reproduce the weaver effect using synthetic paste. This lead to early
research in creating stable effects, and the first stable machines.

It was theorised that the weaver effect works by creating a kind of
‘subtraction’ localised in space that naturally attracts solid matter. The
orientation of the material used is critical to the working effect.

#### The Blyn Ring

It was also around this time that simple kinesis effects via deliberate [mental
coupling](lore:attrapulsive-coupling) started to become possible. Modified
forms of the Blyn ring could be used to hold small projectiles, and triggered
to collapse the stable effect on command via a coupling rod. It became clear
that steady levitation of non-attrapulsive objects was theoretically possible,
but would require very precise engineering to achieve.
