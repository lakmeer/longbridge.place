Fancy is a mild narcotic [elixir](lore:elixir) commonly found at parties and
celebrations. It produces a euphoric effect that lasts a few hours.

A single dose of fancy is about one mouthful (~30ml). Taking too much (more
than 200ml or so) of fancy in one dose is dangerous and will make the user quite
sick. Prolonged use lowers the user's tolerance to aurum toxicity.

[Aurum toxicity](lore:aurum#aurum-toxicity) will gradually set in with regular
use, which manifests as tiny reflective flecks accumulating in the fingernails,
and eventually leads to degenerative health complications. Regular users will
sometimes wear gloves or nail polish to cover them.
