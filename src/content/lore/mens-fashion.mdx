Long hair, usually in a ponytail or single braid. Can be very long, sometimes
bound with metal rings. Beards are common. Most men wear close fitting shirts
and a below-the-knee, pleated kilt, worn with a belt, and sometimes a leather
apron. Long, thick overcoats and thick socks or stockings are normal in cold
weather.

Large, thick belts with elaborate buckles are associated with craftmanship, and
many men pride themselves on having made their own belt buckles with rare or
valuable materials. Work or craft tools worn on the belt are associated with
masculinity. Heavy boots are associated with manual labour and have been
elevated to a masculine signifier in general fashion.
