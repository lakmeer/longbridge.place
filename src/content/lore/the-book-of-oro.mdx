Also referred to as just 'Oro', the Book of Oro is a mythical compendium of all
of the interesting and noteworthy events in the entire history of Longbridge,
written and compiled by Orothas; a deity responsible for this task. There is no
physical or readable edition of the book; it functions as a representation of
fate, destiny, luck and history.

Orothas watches the escapades of all of the citizens of Longbridge, and records
them in an ongoing narrative that captures their stories. Not all events will
make it into the book, most day-to-day banalaties are not noteworthy enough to
record.

Citizens will pray to Orothas for favourable outcomes for their endeavours, but
Orothas' obligation is only to what makes the best story, not to to steer
history in their best interests, or even their safety.
