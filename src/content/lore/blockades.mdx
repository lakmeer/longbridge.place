Serious disputes between neighbouring enclaves sometimes result in a blockade,
where one or both enclaves physically obstruct the Street to prevent outsiders
passing. It is a drastic form of protest similar to a general strike.

This is considered a very radical, short-sighted action, and is very strongly
frowned upon since it obstructs unrelated citizens getting where they need to
go, and prevents the delivery of important necessary resources to enclaves
further along the bridge. Because the downstream effects are very serious, a
blockade has not happened in a very long time, and they have usually been
swiftly dealt with by a coalition of other affected enclaves showing up to have
a “tool-assisted discussion” about it. Even bitterly warring enclaves will try
to resolve disputes by almost any means necessary before resorting to a
blockade, as it will not win them any allies.
