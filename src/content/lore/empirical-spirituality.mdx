Longbridge in it’s [enlightenment era](lore:enlightenment-era) has a weird kind
of ‘empirical spirituality’, wherein citizens talk about the reality of their
lives in terms of deities with names, personalities, responsibilities and
agency, but have a very practical and egalitarian relationship with these
beings. The exception to this is [Yx](lore:yx), which is just the deterministic
mechanics of the universe and doesn’t have a personality or agency.
