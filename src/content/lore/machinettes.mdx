Machinettes are small [stable machines](lore:stable-machines) that do useful
jobs, like door locks and amplifiers. With careful engineering and arrangement
of miniature rods, attrapulsive forces can be pinned, forming static fields
that enable objects to hover or levitate stably.

Miniaturisation of stable machines is a recent development in the field of
attrapulsion, and has been used to create increasingly complicated devices.
It is the most active area of research in the field in the present day, and
is being led by researchers in both the 
[University](location:university-in-the-middle)
and in independent laboratories in [Pulserâ€™s Clave](location:pulsers-clave).
