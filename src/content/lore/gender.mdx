The culture of Longbridge has developed with the unquestioned assumption that
an in-between gender is obvious and unremarkable. This doesn’t mean that
everyone is super progressive and tolerant, just that ideological clashes and
authoritarian control operate along different axes. Although all three
classes have fairly well-defined fashion styles and social expectations,
stepping outside these boundaries is common and not often questioned or
socially policed.

only expected to adopt a concrete gender expression when they reach [young
adulthood](lore:juntari)’.
