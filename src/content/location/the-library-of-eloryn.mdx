is home to the institution of the [Library of Eloryn](lore:library-of-eloryn).

It has a grand entrance hall containing many reception desks where visitors can
delivery their questions or request books. Above the hall is are several
stories, most given to the storage of books, notes and artifacts, but also
includes a warren of offices where Librarians update and organise the library's
knowledge, the librarian dormitories, and a large room where librarians prepare
answers to visitor's queries.

The Library of Eloryn is both a real building, located in Union, and a
[living institution](lore:library-of-eloryn) charged with recording,
organising, interpreting, and making available all information in Longbridge,
thereby generating and maintaining [Eloryn](lore:eloryn) as an entity.
