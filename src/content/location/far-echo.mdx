Far Echo, formerly known as Warsong, is a haunting yet fascinating uninhabited
section of Longbridge about <Embed.Todo note="120km long" />. It is littered
with the remnants of an ancient battle that apparently occurred long before 
[the split](lore:the-split).

It has now been thoroughly picked over for metals and other raw materials not
found naturally on the bridge, but may yet hide more secrets to be discovered.
Although uninhabited by the standards of other enclaves, you can find small
encampments of treasure hunters, history academics, and vagrants in Far Echo.
