title: Leans
name: Leans
type: Enclave
location: 7-tern, 8-tern
---
By far the longest and poorest enclave, Leans is very densely populated.
Because of the crowding, many of the buildings have been built to [hang over the
side of the bridge](lore:overhangs), a dangerous but necessary option for some
residents. Leans does not have a functioning [Citizenâ€™s Union](lore:citizens-unions)
and has the highest rate of [crime](lore:justice) on the Bridge. It is known
for its vibrant [Zeroth-Day](lore:zeroth-day) parties.

### Far Leans
Leans is so long that it spans both of the 7-tern and 8-tern major pillars. The
8-tern end is less densely populated than the inward end, but is growing
steadily. It is also less developed, with fewer commerce outlets and less
infrastructure for daily needs. The 8-tern end of Leans is sometimes called Far Leans.
