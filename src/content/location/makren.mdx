Makren is an enclave of Longbridge 4 pillars tern of The Middle. It is
known as a hub of commerce and nightlife.

Makren was founded by the wealthy 
[lineage of the same name](lore:makren-lineage). 
This conveys upon it's residents the usual property that their 
[residential name](lore:auxiliary-names) is also a
[lineage-name](lore:auxiliary-names), giving residents of Makren
the name Makreland, which makes it sound like all residents are members of the
founder's lineage.

The Citizen's Union of Makren, and therefore the enclave itself, is almost
entirely controlled by the Makren lineage. This seems to work well enough;
despite the relative lack of democratic input from citizens, the Makren lineage
is relatively well liked and respected, and does a satisfactory job of
administering the enclave, and provides popular public services and works
such as [the later tree](lore:the-later-tree).
