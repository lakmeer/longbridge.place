Pre-split structures hosting many greenhouses, gardens, and arboretums. In the
early days after the split, this area provided the growing city with almost all
of its food, before the Bridgehand was a viable source. 

In modern times, it still grows a lot of food, but also supplies mixing
ingredients, textiles, enriched soil and building materials. The residents are
known for their expertise in mixing, and for breeding the slug-like
[bugs](lore:bug) that recycle the soil beds used for agriculture. There are
relatively few residential structures in Conservatory. It also functions as the
de-facto hub for those wanting to learn the art of mixing outside of the
academic context provided by the University.
