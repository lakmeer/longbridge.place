Haven is a peaceful residential enclave. This enclave pioneered the concept of
[single-family residences](lore:lineages) as a permanent form of housing very
early after [the split](lore:the-split), and remains one of the largest
primarily-residential enclaves, and is home to the majority of lesser family
lineages. 

Many of the residents here focus on distributing community resources to do with
raising families, including buildings specifically for
[socialising children](lore:child-rearing), and providing vocational guidance
to young adults.
