The earliest primarily residential enclave, it is now a commerce district of a
noticeably higher wealth class, where high artisans of various crafts can be
found.

Of the remaining residential living spaces, almost all are very expensive
commonhouses where the greater family lineages occupy prestigious
[pre-split](lore:the-split) stone buildings, and aristocrats mix and mingle.
