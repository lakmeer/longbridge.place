Union is the former centre of Longbridgeâ€™s previous majority religion,
[The Assembly of Veil & Sky](lore:assembly-of-veil-and-sky). With a variety of
temples, shrines, and meditation spaces, the enclave attracts residents and
visitors seeking spiritual growth and enlightenment. 

Union is also the home of the [Library of Eloryn](location:the-library-of-eloryn),
and is a centre for the study of ancient documents related to Longbridge's lost
connection to [the ground](lore:the-ground). The [CU](lore:citizens-unions) of
Union is de-facto governed by the Library, but also hosts regular public forums
to take the input of regular citizens.
