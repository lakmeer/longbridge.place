Foundry is a large industrial enclave dedicated to metal and stoneworking. Most
of the building materials for new structures are produced or processed here. It
is hot and acrid most of the time.

The [Citizen's Union](lore:citizens-unions) of Foundry is elective and
term-limited, and mostly concerned with economic relationships with
[The Middle](location:the-middle), city administration and other enclaves, and
candidates spend much time campaigning to win the support of important industry
directors.
