Abreast is an overhead patchwork of rope bridges and suspended decks several
stories taller than it’s neighbours.

[Citizen's Union](lore:citizens-unions) leadership in Abreast is determined by
lottery, and rotated every few years. At the end of one’s tenure in the CU,
popular leaders are rewarded with choice of the best residences, and unpopular
ones can be shunned from the whole enclave. Abreast also features a wide array
of experimental architectural styles, visible as vertical strata in the
ever-growing buildings.
