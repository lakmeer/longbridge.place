A short and recently established enclave, Pulserâ€™s Clave is a haven for those
who find the regulations on research and development of [attrapulsive
technologies](lore:attrapulsion#applications) to cramp their style.
Residents are free to experiment on themselves and each other, leading to
accidental discoveries and calamities in equal measure. 

Leadership in the [Citizen's Union](lore:citizens-unions) here is determined by
skill in attrapulsion and technological prowess.
