A [musical](lore:music) and cultural hub, filled with theatres, concert halls,
and practice spaces, where musicians, singers, and dancers come together to
perform and hone their craft.

The enclave is known for its vibrant street performances and festivals, which
draw crowds from all over the city. Living is almost exclusively in
commonhouses, and family life is not commonly found. It also has a thriving
culture of street art, with many colourful murals that change frequently.
