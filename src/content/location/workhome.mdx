Guilds, workshops and residences for those who work with the products of the
Bridgehand. The residents here travel daily to the Bridgehand to harvest slime,
timber, fruit and [other things](lore:products-of-the-bridgehand) to deliver
to the rest of the city, or form into products for sale. Many renowned artisans
of [mycoglass](lore:mycoglass) and [mycowood](lore:mycowood) craftsmanship live
and work here, where the [shophouses](lore:shophouses) show off their
spectacular goods. It is one of the earlier enclaves despite being so far from
[The Middle](location:the-middle).
