Guilds, workshops and residences for those who work with the products of the
Bridgehand. The residents here travel daily to the Bridgehand to harvest slime,
timber, fruit and [other things](lore:products-of-the-bridgehand) to deliver
to the rest of the city, or form into products for sale. Many renowned artisans
of [mycoglass](lore:mycoglass) and [mycowood](lore:mycowood) craftsmanship live
and work here, where the [shophouses](lore:shophouses) show off their
spectacular goods. It is one of the earlier enclaves despite being so far from
[The Middle](location:the-middle).

## Founding

<Embed.Todo note="integrate history of workhome with COTH-archaic article" />

Early Workhome was a disorganised grouping of dwellings constructed from the
raw materials of the Bridgehand, and would only gain proper buildings much
later on. Since the Hand seemed to provide more than enough edible fruits and
usable materials, devotees lived simple, agrarian lives farming the Bridgehand
for their daily needs and spending their free time in celebration, worship and
leisure. This unstructured mode of living wasn’t without it’s complications,
but if one was willing to adapt to the relatively primitive infrastructure, and
undertake the work of foraging their own supplies, Workhome represented a big
improvement in quality of life (outside of the ongoing conflicts with the
remaining adherents of the Order of Solus).
