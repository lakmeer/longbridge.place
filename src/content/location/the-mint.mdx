Containing the [building](lore:the-mint) of the same name, The Mint is the
oldest and most prestigious enclave outside of The Middle. Cost of living here
is very high. 

Home to many wealthy families and political movers, and boasting the highest
class of goods available on the bridge. 
It is also home to many pre-split mausoleums which keep the dead of significant
enough note.
