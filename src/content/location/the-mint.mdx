Containing the building of the same name, The Mint is the oldest and most
prestigious enclave outside of The Middle. Home to many wealthy families and
political movers, and boasting the highest class of goods available on the
bridge. Cost of living here is very high. It is also home to many pre-split
mausoleums which keep the dead of significant enough note.
