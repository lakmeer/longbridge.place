- Masculine names tend not to start with vowel sounds
- Don’t use **‘q’** in any names
- No names should use a pure **‘h’** sound anywhere
- Don’t start names with **q**, **x**, or **z**
- Generally, the **‘i’** glyph is pronounced with a short high vowel [i] (‘ee’)
- The **‘k’** sound should be spelled with a single **‘k’, not **‘ck’** or **‘c’**
- The **‘s’** sound should be spelled with an **‘s’** and not a **‘c’**
- Names should end in **‘lon’**, **‘lin’**, **‘lyn’** or **‘land’**, as this suffix is for lineage names
- There should be a roughly even distribution of one, two, and three syllable names
- There can and should be exceptions to all of these rules if they sound believable
