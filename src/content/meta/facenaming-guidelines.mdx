**There can and should be exceptions to these rules if they sound believable.**

| Tip | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| There should be a roughly even distribution of one, two, and three syllable names | |
| Don’t start names with **q**, **x**, or **z** | |
| Don’t use **q** in any names | |
| Don't use the **h** sound `[h]` in any names | |
| Don't use the **sh** sound `[ʃ]` in any names | |
| In feminine names, the **i** glyph is usually pronounced with a high vowel `[i]` (ee) | Elize `[eliːz]` |
| The `[k]` sound should be spelled with a **k** and not **ck** or **c** | ~~Derrick~~ Derrik |
| The `[s]` sound should be spelled with an **s** and not a **c** | ~~Celine~~ Seline |
| Names should **not** end in **-lon**, **-lin**, **-lyn** or **-land**, as this suffix is used for lineage auxiliary names | |
| Names with a medial consonant cluster are considered masculine | Kendrik, Dristan |
| Names ending with **-on** or **-an** are considered masculine | Korvan, Branson |
| Names ending with hard consonants are usually considered masculine | Brannik, Pyt |
| Names ending with vowels, or containing the `[i]` vowel, are considered feminine | Eliara, Maline |
| Names ending with **-ize**, or **-x** are considered feminine | Lennyx, Telize |
| Names with the same vowel in the initial and final position are considered niadine | Oro, Aldra |
| Names ending with **-yn** or **-ys** are considered niadine | Lys, Taryn |
| Names that would be spelled with an initial **E** can be spelled with a **Y** and pronounced `[ɪ]` | Yliza, Yra |
